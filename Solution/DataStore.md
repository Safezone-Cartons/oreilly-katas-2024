# Data Collection and processing on Edge-Gateway

In order to process data from medical input devices we will use Telegraf within our Edge Gateway system. 

In combination with InfluxDB is can handle our requirements for collecting and processing data from various vital sign devices 

- [ADR 08-Telegraf](../ADRs/08-Telegraf.md)  
- [ADR 09-InfluxDB](../ADRs/09-InfluxDB.md)

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare IoT Devices:**
    - *Scenario:* Telegraf can collect data from healthcare IoT devices like wearable sensors, monitoring patient vitals and activities, and sending the information to a central database for further analysis.
