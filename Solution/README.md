# Solution

## Summary 

The aim of our solution is to guaranty the highest autonmoy of each nurse station. 
Therefore, we present a system which is capable to function even if the central hub is disconnected.

Throughout the following Solution sheets, we will deep dive into the core of the EGW-System.

- [Diagram Technique](DiagramTechnique.md) will clarify how to read our graphical diagrams
- [Overall Architecture Style Analysis](ArchitecturePattern.md) explains our chosen software architecture 
- [Conceptual System Design](Conceptual.md) will showcase in 3 levels how the system is structured
    - [Overall System](OverallSystem.md) C1 representation of the System
    - [Edge Gateway System](EdgeGatewaylSystem.md) C2 representation of the EGW
    - [Edge Gateway Container](EdgeGatewayContainer.md) C3 Representation of the EGW
- [Data Store Processing](DataStore.md) clarifies how we collect and process data
- [Provisioning](Provisioning.md) services    
- System [Deployment](Deployment.md) process
- [Hardware](HardwareConnectivity.md) connectivity
- [QR Device](QRDeviceRegistryFlow.md) to Patient registry flow
- [ADRs](../ADRs/README.md)
