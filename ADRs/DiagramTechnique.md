# Digram technique 

Date: 15/02/2024 

## Status

Approved

## Context

To ensure a comprehensive diagramm understanding between all participants and judges we need to agree to a standarised digramm format. 


## Decision

Digram standard C4 Model with 4 levels of deepness

## Consequences

If we do not agree to a stndardized format, the judges will have difficulties to follow our plan and structure and devaluate the proposed ideas.
A standarized and well known format makes it easy to understand the overall architecture.
