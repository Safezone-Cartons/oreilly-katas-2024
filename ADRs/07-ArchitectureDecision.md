Per hospital, we will deploy several system, which require to have a consistency across all nurse stations. 
The system for our Edge-Gateway should be simple to set up and may handle time critical operations with a high grade on performance.

In addition to that our Edge-Gateways do not need to change often if set up once.

Furthermore, we need to ensure system stability and maintainability.

## Consequences

Positive:
