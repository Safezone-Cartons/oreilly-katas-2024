## Constraints

- The MonitorMe system needs to be hosted on-premise within a hospital

---

### Assumptions

- StayHealth, Inc. will be providing hardware that is capable of sending data as an IoT device over a local network
- Each vital sign device has a unique QR-Code code with the device identifier
- Each (nurse) station within the Hospital has a internal network set up that MonitorMe can use
