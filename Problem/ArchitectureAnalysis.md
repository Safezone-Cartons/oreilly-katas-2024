# Architecture Analysis

## Key Characteristics

We can determine the least-worst option by first determining the essential architectural features of this solution. The recommended approach is to list no more than seven.  
These will then influence the MonitorMe system's overall architecture, along with the implicit architecture features.

|       | Flexibility      | //tbd             |
|       | Fault tolerance  | //tbd             |
| 3     | Agility          | //tbd             |
|       | Interoperability | //tbd             |


### Implicit Characteristics

The following architecture characteristics may not directly affect the structure on the overall system
however they will feed into this

- Maintainability
- Security
- Flexibility
- *Recoverability*
